# Local Development Guide for Stripe Integration

## Setting Up Local Webhook Testing

### Prerequisites
1. Install Stripe CLI (https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli)
2. Ensure you have your Stripe API keys ready

### Local Development Setup

1. Start the webhook listener:
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5000/api/payments/webhook
```

2. Copy the webhook signing secret provided by the CLI and set it as your STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET environment variable.

3. Test webhooks using the Stripe CLI:
```bash
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
```

### Testing Different Events
Common test events:
- `payment_intent.succeeded`
- `customer.subscription.created`
- `customer.subscription.updated`
- `customer.subscription.deleted`
- `invoice.paid`
- `invoice.payment_failed`

### Development vs Production

#### Development Environment
- Use Stripe CLI to forward webhook events to localhost
- Use test API keys
- Test with Stripe's test card numbers
- Monitor webhook events in real-time

#### Production Environment
1. Set up a public HTTPS endpoint
2. Configure webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard
3. Use production API keys
4. Set up proper error handling and logging
5. Monitor webhook delivery in Stripe Dashboard

### Webhook Endpoint Implementation

The webhook endpoint should:
1. Verify Stripe signature
2. Parse the event
3. Handle specific event types
4. Return 200 response quickly
5. Process events asynchronously if needed

### Best Practices

1. Always verify webhook signatures
2. Return 2xx response quickly
3. Handle duplicated events gracefully
4. Log webhook errors for debugging
5. Use webhook monitoring
6. Implement retry logic for failed events

### Testing Guide

1. Local Testing with Stripe CLI:
```bash
# Start webhook forwarding
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5000/api/payments/webhook

# Trigger test events
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
stripe trigger customer.subscription.created
```

2. Test Card Numbers:
- Success: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- Decline: 4000 0000 0000 0002
- 3D Secure: 4000 0000 0000 3220

3. Test Webhook Processing:
- Verify signature validation
- Check event handling
- Confirm database updates
- Test error scenarios

### Troubleshooting

Common Issues:
1. Webhook signature verification fails
   - Check STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET is correct
   - Ensure raw body parsing is properly configured

2. Events not being received
   - Verify Stripe CLI is running
   - Check forwarding URL is correct
   - Confirm server is listening on correct port

3. Database updates not working
   - Check event handling logic
   - Verify database connections
   - Review error logs

4. Production Issues
   - Verify HTTPS endpoint is accessible
   - Check server logs for errors
   - Monitor webhook delivery in Stripe Dashboard

### Security Considerations

1. Always use HTTPS in production
2. Keep webhook secrets secure
3. Validate webhook signatures
4. Process sensitive data securely
5. Implement proper error handling
6. Monitor for suspicious activity

### Monitoring and Maintenance

1. Regular Tasks:
   - Monitor webhook delivery
   - Check for failed events
   - Review error logs
   - Update API versions
   - Test webhook endpoint health

2. Alerts:
   - Set up alerts for failed webhooks
   - Monitor for high error rates
   - Track webhook latency
   - Alert on signature verification failures

Remember: Local development requires different handling than production. Always use test API keys and the Stripe CLI for local development to avoid affecting live data.

## Local Webhook Testing Instructions

### Option 1: Using Stripe CLI (Recommended)

1. Install the Stripe CLI:
   ```bash
   # On macOS
   brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

   # On Windows
   scoop install stripe

   # On Linux
   # Download the latest linux tar.gz from https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/latest
   ```

2. Login to your Stripe account:
   ```bash
   stripe login
   ```

3. Start webhook forwarding:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5000/api/payments/webhook
   ```

4. Save the webhook signing secret:
   - When you start the listener, it will display a webhook signing secret
   - Set this as your STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET environment variable

5. Test webhook events:
   ```bash
   # In a new terminal window
   stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
   stripe trigger customer.subscription.created
   stripe trigger invoice.payment_succeeded
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Testing

You can use our test script to simulate webhook events:

1. Import the test helper:
   ```typescript
   import { simulateWebhookEvent } from './scripts/test-webhook';
   ```

2. Create and send a test event:
   ```typescript
   const event = await simulateWebhookEvent('payment_intent.succeeded');
   const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/payments/webhook', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: {
       'Content-Type': 'application/json',
       'Stripe-Signature': 'test_signature'
     },
     body: JSON.stringify(event)
   });
   ```

Note: Manual testing won't pass signature verification. Use Stripe CLI for full testing.

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. "No signature found" error:
   - Ensure you're using the Stripe CLI
   - Check that STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET is set correctly

2. "Signature verification failed" error:
   - Verify you're using the correct webhook secret
   - Check that the request body hasn't been modified

3. No events being received:
   - Confirm the Stripe CLI is running
   - Check the forwarding URL is correct
   - Verify your server is running on port 5000

4. Database updates not working:
   - Check the logs for any SQL errors
   - Verify the event handler logic in stripeService

### Production Deployment

When deploying to production:

1. Update the webhook endpoint URL in Stripe Dashboard to your production URL:
   `https://wordgen.io/api/payments/webhook`

2. Generate a new webhook signing secret for production
   - Go to Stripe Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks
   - Add endpoint
   - Save the new signing secret

3. Set up monitoring for webhook errors
   - Use Stripe Dashboard's webhook logs
   - Set up error notifications
   - Monitor failed webhook attempts

Remember: Always use test API keys and the Stripe CLI during local development to avoid affecting production data.
