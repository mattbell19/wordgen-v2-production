#### brief to explain how the bulk generation should work

Objective:
Add a Bulk Article Generation feature to the AI SEO Tool, enabling users to generate multiple SEO-optimized articles at once. This feature will allow users to input one keyword per line, generate articles sequentially, and organize them into user-created "projects." The implementation will be structured in a clear, step-by-step manner to ensure the project is not compromised during development on Replit.

Key Features to Implement:
Project Creation:

Allow users to create a "project" to organize articles.

Each project will have a name and optional description.

Bulk Keyword Input:

Users input one keyword per line in a text area.

Each keyword will generate one article.

Sequential Article Generation:

Send article generation requests one keyword at a time to the OpenAI API.

Save each generated article to the corresponding project.

Article Organization:

Display all articles within a project in a clean, organized format.

Allow users to view, edit, or download articles individually or as a CSV file.

Progress Tracking:

Show real-time progress (e.g., "Generating article 3 of 10").

Provide a progress bar or spinner for visual feedback.

Error Handling:

Handle errors gracefully (e.g., API failures, invalid keywords) and allow users to retry failed articles.

Step-by-Step Implementation Plan:
Step 1: Backend Setup
Project Management Endpoint:

Create an API endpoint to handle project creation and management.

Store project details (name, description, articles) in a database.

Bulk Article Generation Endpoint:

Develop an endpoint to process one keyword at a time.

For each keyword:

Call the OpenAI API to generate the article.

Save the article to the corresponding project in the database.

Error Handling:

Log errors for failed articles and allow retries.

Notify users of any issues during the process.

Step 2: Frontend Development
Project Creation Interface:

Add a form for users to create a new project (name and description).

Bulk Keyword Input Interface:

Add a text area for users to input one keyword per line.

Include a button to start the article generation process.

Progress Indicator:

Show real-time progress (e.g., "Generating article 3 of 10").

Display a progress bar or spinner.

Article Display and Organization:

Create a table or list to display all articles within a project.

Include options to:

View individual articles.

Download articles as a CSV file.

Edit or regenerate specific articles.

Error Notifications:

Display error messages for failed articles with an option to retry.

Step 3: Testing and Optimization
Test with Small Batches:

Test the feature with small batches of keywords (e.g., 5-10) to ensure functionality.

Optimize API Calls:

Implement rate limiting to avoid exceeding OpenAI API quotas.

Use caching where possible to reduce redundant API calls.

Error Handling Testing:

Simulate errors (e.g., API failures) to ensure the system handles them gracefully.

Performance Testing:

Test the feature with large batches (e.g., 50+ keywords) to ensure stability and performance.

Step 4: Deployment and Documentation
Deploy to Replit:

Ensure the feature is integrated into the existing Replit project.

Test the deployed version to confirm everything works as expected.

Documentation:

Provide clear instructions for users on how to use the bulk article generation feature.

Include troubleshooting tips for common issues.

Workflow Example:
User Creates a Project:

Names the project "Blog Posts Q4 2023" and adds a description.

User Inputs Keywords:

Inputs 10 keywords (one per line) in the text area.

Tool Processes Articles:

Generates articles one by one, showing progress in real-time.

Saves each article to the "Blog Posts Q4 2023" project.

User Reviews Output:

Views all 10 articles in a table within the project.

Downloads the articles as a CSV file.

Edits or regenerates specific articles if needed.

Deliverables:
Bulk Article Generation Feature:

Backend endpoints for project management and article generation.

Frontend interface for project creation, keyword input, progress tracking, and output display.

Error Handling and Notifications:

Graceful error handling and user notifications.

Documentation:

User guide and troubleshooting tips.
