## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Each component will have dedicated unit tests
- Test coverage goal: 80% minimum
- Focus on algorithm correctness and edge cases

### Integration Testing
- Test API integrations with mock services
- Verify data flow between components
- Ensure proper error handling and fallbacks

### UI Testing
- Test user interface components for proper rendering
- Verify user interactions and state management
- Ensure responsive design across devices

### Performance Testing
- Measure generation time for various article lengths
- Test system under load with concurrent requests
- Verify caching mechanisms are effective

## Success Metrics
