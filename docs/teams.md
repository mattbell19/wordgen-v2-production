# Team Management Documentation

## Overview
The team management system allows users to create and manage teams for collaborative content creation and SEO optimization. Each user can create one team and invite other users to join their team.

## Features

### Team Creation
- Users can create one team per account
- Teams require a name and optional description
- The team creator automatically becomes the team admin

### Roles and Permissions

#### Admin Role
Admins have full access to team management with the following permissions:
- Invite new team members
- Remove team members
- Edit team settings
- Create and edit content
- Delete content
- Approve content
- Manage keywords
- View analytics

#### Member Role
Members have limited access focused on content creation:
- Create content
- View team content
- Manage keywords
- View analytics
- Cannot modify team settings or manage members

### Team Management

#### Inviting Members
1. Admins can invite new members by email
2. Invitees must have an existing account in the system
3. Invitations are sent with a default "Member" role
4. Invited users must accept the invitation to join the team

#### Member Status
Members can have the following statuses:
- `pending`: Invited but hasn't accepted yet
- `active`: Accepted invitation and actively participating
- `inactive`: Temporarily disabled access

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
The team system uses three main tables:
- `teams`: Stores team information and settings
- `team_roles`: Defines available roles and their permissions
- `team_members`: Manages team membership and user roles

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/teams`: List user's teams
- `GET /api/teams/:id`: Get team details
- `PATCH /api/teams/:id`: Update team settings
- `DELETE /api/teams/:id`: Delete a team (admin only)

#### Member Management
- `POST /api/teams/:id/invite`: Invite new member
- `POST /api/teams/:id/accept-invitation`: Accept team invitation
- `PATCH /api/teams/:id/members/:memberId`: Update member role
- `DELETE /api/teams/:id/members/:memberId`: Remove member from team
