# Webflow Integration

## Overview
The Webflow integration allows users to publish articles directly to their Webflow CMS collections. This integration uses Webflow's API v2 to authenticate and manage content.

## Features
- Connect to Webflow using site-specific API keys
- List available sites and collections
- Publish articles as draft entries to selected collections
- Automatic error handling and validation

## Setup Requirements
1. A Webflow account with CMS access
2. Site-specific API key (starts with `site_`)
3. Read and write permissions enabled for the API key

## Implementation Details
- Authentication: Uses Webflow's API key authentication
- API Version: 2.0.0
- Endpoint Base: https://api.webflow.com/v2

## Error Handling
The integration handles common error cases:
- Invalid API key format
- Insufficient permissions
- Rate limiting
- Network issues
- Resource not found

## Usage Flow
1. User enters site-specific API key
2. System validates key format and permissions
3. User selects target site and collection
4. Article is published as draft to selected collection

## Security Considerations
- API keys are validated server-side
- Keys must be site-specific for security
- All requests use HTTPS
- Error messages are sanitized for production

## Limitations
- Only supports draft publication initially
- One site connection at a time
- API rate limits apply
