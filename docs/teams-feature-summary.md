# Teams Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

The teams feature allows users to:
1. Create and manage teams
2. Invite team members via email
3. Switch between personal and team accounts
4. Share content (articles, keywords, projects) between team members
5. Manage team members (add/remove)

## Key Components

### Database Changes
- Added `activeTeamId` to users table to track which team a user is currently using
- Added `email` field to team_members table for pending invitations
- Made `userId` nullable in team_members table for pending invitations

### Backend API Endpoints
- Team management endpoints:
  - `/api/teams` - Create and list teams
  - `/api/teams/:id` - Get team details
  - `/api/teams/switch` - Switch between personal and team accounts
  - `/api/teams/:teamId/invite` - Send team invitations
  - `/api/teams/:teamId/members/:memberId` - Manage team members
  - `/api/teams/invites/*` - Handle invitation acceptance/rejection

- Data sharing:
  - Updated articles, keywords, and projects routes to use team context
  - Added team context utilities for data access

### Frontend Components
- Team management UI:
  - TeamProvider context for managing team state
  - TeamSwitcher component for switching between personal and team accounts
  - TeamInviteForm for sending invitations
  - TeamMemberList for managing team members
  - Team creation page
  - Team invitation acceptance page

## User Flow

1. **Creating a Team**
   - User navigates to Teams page
   - User clicks "Create New Team"
   - User enters team name and description
   - System creates team and adds user as owner/admin

2. **Inviting Team Members**
   - Team owner/admin navigates to team details page
   - Owner/admin enters email address of person to invite
   - System sends invitation email with accept link
   - Invitee receives email and clicks accept link
   - Invitee is added to the team

3. **Switching Between Accounts**
   - User clicks on team switcher in header
   - User selects personal account or a team account
   - System switches context and updates UI
   - All data operations now use the selected context

4. **Sharing Content**
   - When in team context, all content created is accessible to all team members
   - Team members can view, edit, and manage shared content
   - Content ownership is preserved (created by the original user)

## Implementation Details

### Team Context
The team context is implemented using:
1. A database field (`activeTeamId`) to track which team a user is currently using
2. A React context provider to manage team state on the frontend
3. Backend utilities to determine the current context and filter data accordingly

### Data Sharing
Data sharing is implemented by:
1. Using the team context to determine which users' data to include in queries
2. Modifying database queries to include data from all team members when in team context
3. Preserving ownership information to track who created each item

### Permissions
Team permissions are implemented using:
1. Team roles (Admin, Member) with different permission sets
2. Permission checks in API endpoints to ensure users can only perform allowed actions
3. UI components that adapt based on user permissions

## Next Steps

1. Run database migrations to apply schema changes
2. Test all team functionality:
   - Team creation
   - Team invitation
   - Team switching
   - Data sharing
   - Member management
3. Update any remaining routes to use team context
4. Add more granular permissions if needed
