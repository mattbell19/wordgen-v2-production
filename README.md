- **Detailed Reports**: Generates comprehensive reports with actionable recommendations

#### API Integration

The SEO Audit System uses DataForSEO's API with the following features:
- Robust error handling with automatic retries
- Rate limiting protection
- Efficient caching for frequently accessed data
- CommonJS compatibility with node-fetch v2.6.9
- Comprehensive test coverage with Jest
- Proper TypeScript typing for all API responses

## Architecture

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- Vite for fast development and bundling
- React Query for data fetching and caching
- Shadcn UI components for consistent design
- React Hook Form with Zod for form validation

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
- Claude AI integration for content generation
- Session-based authentication
- Comprehensive error handling

## Error Handling System

We've implemented a robust error handling system consisting of:

1. **Reusable Error Components**:
   - `ErrorDisplay`: A flexible component for displaying different types of errors
   - `NetworkError`: For connection issues
   - `AuthenticationError`: For auth-related errors
   - `ValidationError`: For form/input validation errors
   - `NotFoundError`: For missing resources

2. **ErrorBoundary Component**:
   - Catches and gracefully handles React component errors
   - Provides a user-friendly fallback UI
   - Includes retry functionality

3. **useApi Hook**:
   - Built-in error handling
   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
   - Consistent error formatting
   - Toast notifications for user feedback

## Authentication Flow

The authentication system uses a session-based approach:

1. User registers or logs in via `/api/register` or `/api/login`
2. Server creates a session and stores session ID in cookies
3. Client uses this session for authenticated requests
4. User data is accessed via React Query with consistent caching
