# WordGen v2 Complete Refactoring & Deployment Plan

## Project Context
- Current: Deployed to GitHub, Hosted on Railway
- Target: Fresh Heroku deployment with new database and environment

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Database Schema Inconsistencies
- Multiple schema definitions (Drizzle vs Prisma)
- Conflicting table structures between `/db/schema.ts` and `/server/db/schema.ts`
- Missing foreign key constraints and proper relationships
- Incomplete migration system

### 2. Project Structure Problems
- Inconsistent file organization
- Mixed client/server code in root directory
- Duplicate configuration files (multiple package.json, schema files)
- Unclear separation of concerns
- Scattered assets and documentation

### 3. Dependency Management Issues
- Outdated and conflicting package versions
- Unnecessary dependencies (both Prisma and Drizzle)
- Missing critical dependencies for production
- Complex dependency tree with potential security vulnerabilities

### 4. Environment Configuration
- Incomplete environment variable validation
- Missing production-ready configurations
- Inconsistent environment handling across files
- No proper secrets management

### 5. Authentication & Security
- Session management issues
- Incomplete CSP configuration
- Missing security middleware
- Potential security vulnerabilities in auth flow

### 6. Build & Deployment
- Complex build process with multiple entry points
- Missing production optimizations
- No proper CI/CD setup
- Not optimized for Heroku deployment

- Remove duplicate files
- Fix basic configuration issues

### Short Term (Phases 2-3) - Next 2-3 hours
- Database schema consolidation
- Dependency management
- Basic security improvements

### Medium Term (Phases 4-5) - Next 4-6 hours
- Environment configuration
- Build system optimization
- Performance improvements

### Final (Phase 6) - Final 2-3 hours
